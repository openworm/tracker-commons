# Introduction

WCON (Worm tracker Commons Object Notation) is a text-based data interchange format for *C. elegans* trackers.  It is a constrained subset of [JSON](http://www.json.org/).  It is designed to be both human and machine readable and to facilitate data exchange and inter-operability for worm tracking data that is independent of platform and the language used for implementation.  Our hope is that working in a common format will also encourage code sharing and development within the community.

WCON has a minimal core description so that the basic data from a tracking experiment can be parsed by any software that is WCON-compatible, regardless of resolution or whether the file is from a single- or multi-worm tracker.  At the same time, we recognise that most groups that develop and use worm trackers have particular features they are interested in that can depend on the specifics of their experiments.  We have included recommendations for how such custom features should be included that can accommodate a wide range of custom features while preserving interchange of the basic tracking data.  Therefore, like JSON itself, we expect other lab- or tracker-specific documentation to refer to this standard in introducing restricted formats.


## Basic implementation

### WCON must be JSON

A WCON file must be valid JSON.  This allows general-purpose JSON parsers to read WCON files.  Such parsers are typically much faster and much better debugged than ad-hoc parsers.  WCON data can then be extracted from the JSON data parsed in memory.

We recommend either `.json` or `.wcon` as a file extension.

### Nomenclature

A JSON _object_ is a set of key-value pairs.  The key is always a string; the value can be anything.  This structure is useful for identifying data by name.

A JSON _array_ is a list of values.  The values can be anything, and need not be the same as each other.  However, in the WCON specification, all arrays do contain the same type of value.

A particular value may be _required_ or _optional_.  Optional values may simply be left out when not present (the whole key-value pair, if part of an object).  Values may also be _single-valued_ or _arrayed_.  A single value is just a single JSON entity of appropriate type.  An arrayed value is zero or more such values inside a JSON array.  If there is only one value, an array need not be used even if it is permitted.  If a value is required, and can be arrayed, then the array must not be empty.

### File structure

A WCON file contains a single JSON object with a minimum of two key-value pairs: `units` and `data`.  The value for `units` is an object that defines the temporal and spatial dimensions of the experiment as strings.  `data` specifies the tracking information, including time and position information, for the animal or animals tracked.

We recommend that you include the key-value pair `"tracker-commons":true` as the first entry in the WCON file to aid easy identification.  A WCON parser should not rely on the presence of this tag, so you may omit it (or not put it first) if you wish, but if the tag is present and the file is not valid WCON, a parser may choose to give more detailed error messages.

#### Example

A WCON file with single-valued `t` and arrayed `x` and `y`:

```JSON
{
    "tracker-commons":true,
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
        { "id":1, "t":1.3, "x":[1215.11, ...], "y":[234.89, ...] },
        { "id":2, ... },
        ...
        { "id":1, "t":1.4, ...},
        ...
    ]
}
```

#### Units

Any numeric quantity followed on a per-animal or per-timepoint basis must have its units defined in an object:

```JSON
"units": {
  "t": "s",
  "x": "mm",
  "y": "mm"
}
```

We recommend that time values be in seconds (specified as one of `"s"`, `"second"`, or `"seconds"`), and that spatial values be in millimetres (specified as one of `"mm"`, `"millimetre"`, or `"millimetres"`) or higher-dimensional versions thereof as appropriate (e.g. `"mm^2"`).

`"units"` is required and must be single-valued.

#### Data

The `"data"` entry contains data for one or more animals at one or more timepoints.  It may be arrayed or single-valued.

A data entry is an object with four required keys.

1. Each worm is identified by a numerical `id` so that multiple worms can be distinguished in one data set.  The `id` must be single-valued (JSON numbers or strings).

2. The time of a recording is specified by `t` (a JSON number).  It may be single-valued, for a single timepoint, or arrayed for a series of timepoints.

3. The body position of an animal is given by `x` and `y`.  These are typically arrayed and represent points along the midline of the body.  They must be the same size.  If `t` is arrayed, then `x` and `y` must be arrays of arrays, with the i<sup>th</sup> index of `x` and `y` having the same size.  If tracking is done at low resolution and the worm is defined using a single xy-coordinate, this is accommodated by simply using this single point for `x` and `y` at each time.

A data array may contain the same ID multiple times with different timepoints.

A WCON file with arrayed t and corresponding nested arrays for `x` and `y`.

```JSON
{
    "tracker-commons":true,
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
        { "id":1,
          "t":[
               1.3,
               1.4,
               1.5
          ],
          "x":[
               [1215.11, ...],
               [1133.24, ...],
               [1039.12, ...]
          ],
          "y":[
               [234.89, ...],
               [350.72, ...],
               [430.10, ...]
          ]
        },
        { "id":2, ... },
        ...
        { "id":1, "t":1.6, ...},
        ...
    ]
}
```

Note that even if some xy-coordinate arrays are nested, it is still possible to repeat an `id` in the same file if the same worm has more tracks later.  Allowing repeats in `id` is convenient for multi-worm tracking data as tracks can be joined simply by updating `id` without having to copy track data.

#### Unknown Contents

**Any software that reads WCON should ignore any unrecognised key-value pair**. This is essential to make WCON flexible and allows the inclusion of custom features and additional information not required by the basic format. Below we specify a method for including custom features and other additions that are included in the accompanying software examples.

#### A Word about Numbers

All numeric values may be floating-point.  However, JSON does not support infinite or not-a-number values permitted by IEEE754 standards that cover almost every floating-point number you might use on a computer.  Since WCON must be valid JSON, custom extensions to JSON (i.e. _not JSON_ but almost) like using `infinity` unquoted to denote a floating-point positive infinity, must be avoided.

If possible, the best solution is to simply leave out non-finite numbers.  However, in some cases (e.g. with arrayed `t`) it may be more practical to indicate missing data inline.  If you wish to embed not-a-number values, use `null`.  Avoid positive or negative infinity; this is not physical data anyway, so can just be replaced with `null`.

## Including custom features

Even seemingly primitive features such as speed can have many variants (centroid vs. midbody vs. head; calculated over a window vs. frame-by-frame; etc.)  Therefore, having a standard feature called "speed" is not sufficiently flexible for wide use.  Instead, custom features are included in a WCON file using group-specific tags that are easily identifiable by `@` followed by a unique identifier.  For software developed in worm labs, use the lab's strain designation as a unique identifier.  A current list of lab strain designations (the first code in capital letters) is available from the CGC (http://cbs.umn.edu/cgc/lab-code) or WormBase (https://www.wormbase.org/resources/laboratory).  If a single group has multiple incompatible feature sets, the strain designation can be followed by a suffix separated from the lab code by a non-letter character (e.g. `"@CF Vikram"` or `"@OMG_1.5"`).  For groups without a strain designation, choose an identifier that is not already on the list of lab strain identifiers.

A WCON file with three custom features:

```JSON
{
    "tracker-commons":true,
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
        {"@OMG":{
               "feature_names":["speed", "curvature", "width"],
               "feature_units":["mm/s", "1/mm", "mm"]
        }},
        { "id":1,
          "t":1.3,
          "x":[1215.11, ...],
          "y":[234.89, ...],
          "@OMG":{ "feature_values":[0.34, 1.5, 0.873] }
        }
        ...
    ]
}
```

For features that describe an entire plate rather than properties of individual worms (such as density or aggregate number), the features object can be added outside of `data`:

```JSON
{
    "tracker-commons":true,
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
        {"@OMG":{
               "feature_names":["speed", "curvature", "width"],
               "feature_units":["mm/s", "1/mm", "mm"]
        }},
		{ "id":1,
          "t":1.3,
          "x":[1215.11, ...],
          "y":[234.89, ...],
          "@OMG":{ "feature_values":[0.34, 1.5, 0.873] }
        }
        ...
    ],
    "@OMG":{
          "plate_feature_names":["density", "aggregate number"],
          "plate_feature_units":["1/mm^2", null],
          "plate_feature_values":[0.1, 8]
    }
}
```

## Common additions handled in accompanying code
It is expected that users will take advantage of the flexibility of the WCON specification to create derivatives.  The following examples are handled by the accompanying code examples.  We recommend that code written in other languages or derivative formats also handle these cases.

### Units

We recommend sticking to seconds and millimetres for time and distance, as denoting those with `"s"` and `"mm"` to make automated parsing as easy as possible.  However, we recognize that these units may not always be natural, so the following should be recognized as common variants for units.

A WCON parser should, if it's going to interpret units, handle the following SI prefixes:

| Prefix   | Abbreviations | Value     |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| centi    | c       | 10<sup>-2</sup> |
| milli    | m       | 10<sup>-3</sup> | 
| micro    | u µ μ   | 10<sup>-6</sup> |
| nano     | n       | 10<sup>-9</sup> |
| kilo     | k K     | 10<sup>3</sup>  |
| mega     | M       | 10<sup>6</sup>  |
| giga     | G       | 10<sup>9</sup>  |

_Note: JSON must be unicode, so the micro-symbol must be encoded as unicode.  There are two choices: "micro symbol" `U+00B5` or "greek mu" `U+03BC`.  Both should be handled.  Some software does not understand unicode, however, so writing `u` is preferred._

The following units should be handled:

| Unit       | Abbreviations |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| second     | s sec         |
| minute     | min           |
| hour       | h             |
| day        | d             |
| metre      | m             |
| inch       | in            |
| micron     | *(none)*      |
| fahrenheit | F             |
| centigrade | *(none)*      |
| kelvin     | K             |
| celsius    | C             |
| percent    | %             |
 
Abbreviated and full versions must not be mixed.  For instance, both `"ms"` and `"milliseconds"` are okay, but `"msecond"` and `"millis"` are not.  Words may be pluralized or not.  Capitalization is significant: `"mm"` and `"Mm"` are not the same (millimetre vs megametre)!

If a numeric quantity is dimensionless, specify the units as an empty string `""`.

### Experiment and software metadata

Information about experimental conditions and software versions is critical for reproducibility across labs.  JSON's flexibility makes it straightforward to include experimental conditions directly in tracking files.  This has the advantage that the data and corresponding metadata will not be separated, making the usefulness of tracking data more durable.  If further tags are required, they can of course be added, but where appropriate we recommend using the following tags.

```JSON
{
    "tracker-commons":true,
    "metadata":{
           "lab":{"location":"CRB, room 5020", "name":"Behavioural Genomics" },
           "who":"Firstname Lastname",
           "timestamp":"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z",
           "temperature":{ "experiment":22, "cultivation":20, "units":"C" },
           "humidity":{ "value":40, "units":"%" },
           "data":{ "type":"petri", "size":35, "units":"mm" },
           "food":" none or OP50 or HB101, ... ",
           "media":" NGM or agarose, ... ",
           "sex":" hermaphrodite or male ",
           "stage":" L1, L2, L3, L4, adult, or dauer ",
           "age":"18:25:43.511",
           "strain":" N2, CB4856, or JU245, �... ",
           "image_orientation":"imaged onto agar or imaged through agar",
           "protocol":"text description of protocol�",
           "software":{
                "tracker":{ "name":"Software Name", "version":1.3 },
                "featureID":"@OMG"
           },
           "settings":"Any valid JSON entry with hardware and software configuration can go here",
     }
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
        { "id":1, "t":1.3, "x":[7.2, ...], "y":[0.5, ...] },
    	...
    ]
}
```

### Worm orientation

To completely define a worm's orientation, it is necessary to know which part of the skeleton corresponds to the head and which side of the worm is dorsal or ventral.  Use `"head":"L"` to indicate that the head is the first xy-coordinate, `"head":"R"` to indicate that the head is the last xy-coordinate, and `"head":"?"` to indicate that the orientation is uncertain.  `"ventral":"CW"` indicates that the ventral side is clockwise from the first xy-coordinate (whether or not the first coordinate is the head), `"ventral":"CCW"` that the ventral side is counterclockwise from the first point, and `"ventral":"?"` that the dorsoventral orientation is unknown.  One or both of head and ventral can be arrayed if orientation changes within an object, but if `t` is a 1 by n array, the arrayed orientation object must have n values.  Single-valued entries for either head or ventral indicate that the single value applies for all times in the current object.

Knowing the head position and the ventral side, it is possible to infer whether a worm is crawling with its left or right side touching the agar surface, but only if it is known whether the image is recorded looking onto the agar surface or looking through the agar so we recommend that this information is also included in the experiment metadata (see above).

```JSON
{
    "tracker-commons":true,
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
�        { "id":1, "t":1.3, "x":[7.2, ...], "y":[0.5, ...],
          "head":"L",
          "ventral":"CCW"
        },
    ]
}
```

### Variable origin
The origin used to define the worm's xy-coordinates can change over time to reduce file size by reducing the magnitude of the numbers in the worm coordinates.  For example, the origin at each time could be the centroid of the worm skeleton or the position of its head in plate coordinates.  Using this convention, as worms move, the scale of their skeleton coordinates does not increase as they move away from an arbitrary plate frame of reference.  The origin coordinates are defined by `ox` and `oy`.  If `t` is a 1 by n array, `ox` and `oy` can be either 1 by n arrays or single valued.  If they are single valued, the same origin is used for all skeletons in the current object.

```JSON
{
    "tracker-commons":true,
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
 	{ "id":1, "t":1.3, "x":[7.2, ...], "y":[0.5, ...],
          "ox":320.4, "oy":920.1
        },
    	...
    ]
}
```

### Splitting large WCON files into chunks

For very long tracking experiments, it may be convenient to split a single experiment across multiple WCON files.  To make it easier to reconstruct tracks across files, we support a `files` object with the following rules:

1. The variable part of the file name (for example a numerical suffix) is listed under `this`
2. To find another file, take the current file name, delete the last instance of the variable part, and replace it with the string in `prev` or `next`
3. There must be at least one `next`, and they occur in temporal order.  If the current file is the last in a series, the single value of `next` can be `null`.
4. There must be at least one `prev`, and they occur in reverse temporal order.  If the current file is the first in a series, the single value of `prev` can be `null`.

To maintain identity across files, ensure `id` use is consistent.

For example, for a directory containing files labelled filename_1.wcon, filename_2.wcon, filename_3.wcon, etc., filename_2.wcon would look like this:

```JSON
{
    "tracker-commons":true,
    "files":{
         "this":"_2",
   �     "prev":["_1", "_0"],
         "next":"_3",
     }
    "units":{"t":"s", "x":"mm", "y":"mm"},
    "data":[
        { "id":1, "t":1.3, "x":[7.2, ...], "y":[0.5, ...] },
    	...
    ]
}
```
